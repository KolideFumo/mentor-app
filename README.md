## Synopsis

This platform is designed to allow collaboration among mentors and mentees. Mentors and mentees are automatched based on interests.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

We are targeting Kenyan youths who mostly don't have access to quality mentorship .
